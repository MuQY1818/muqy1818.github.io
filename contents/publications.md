**PiN-Mod: Personalised Cross-modal Image Generation Based on Identity-guide Noise Modulation**
***Weijue Bu*** (First Author)
*Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence*
*June 2024 - Present*

**Abstract**: This research addresses the identity consistency challenge in cross-modal image generation by proposing the PiN-Mod technique. Through novel identity-guided noise modulation strategies, we achieved significant improvements in identity preservation and cross-modal semantic alignment capabilities for personalised image generation tasks.

## üî¨ Current Research Projects

### 1. Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection (First Author)
*May 2025 - Present*

Addressing the "black box" problem in time series anomaly detection by designing and implementing an interpretable deep learning framework. The framework features a lightweight Hourglass Temporal Autoencoder (HTA-AD) and Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) modules, achieving model interpretability through feature disentanglement.

**Key Achievements**:
- Achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both TSB-AD-U and TSB-AD-M benchmarks
- Challenged the traditional notion that "performance and interpretability are mutually exclusive"
- Provided new insights for building trustworthy AI systems

### 2. Adaptive Learning Path Planning System (Core Developer)
*July 2025 - Present*

A "Challenge Cup" competition project developing an adaptive learning system driven by large language models and knowledge graphs, providing personalized and efficient learning path planning for students.

**Key Contributions**:
- Designed and implemented the core ORCDF cognitive diagnosis framework
- Developed full-stack system architecture (FastAPI backend, React frontend)
- Improved cognitive diagnosis accuracy by over 20%

### 3. PortraitEditX Dataset
*June 2024 - Present*

Constructed and released a specialized dataset for personalized portrait generation research, supporting the development of identity-consistent text-to-image generation models.
